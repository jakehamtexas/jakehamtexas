# So Basically, Quasar Is Amazing

I wrote a personal website using Quasar.js, and it's been one of the most straightforward, speedy experiences I've ever had writing Vue.js code. And it looks pretty good!

_All of the old quasar goodness is below for anybody looking to debug this on their own, for whatever reason._

#### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

##### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
```

##### Lint the files

```bash
npm run lint
```

##### Build the app for production

```bash
quasar build
```

##### Customize the configuration

See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
